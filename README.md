## Cyclistic-Case-Study:
#A case study done as part of my Google career certificate program, Practicing coding in R. 
For this case study I was asked to take on the role of a junior data anayist working at a ficticious bike sharing service, Cyclistic. I was given two data sets covering a total of 6 months of data and asked to identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
